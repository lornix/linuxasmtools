hitting the space bar does not terminate error.
sometimes error leaves the keyboard in wrong state? multiple errorss?

can we save and restore the cursor positon?  We are using same display
as parent and need to avoid confusion.

change message to say, press enter key.

also display error # ?

add help option.

add option to display all errors
