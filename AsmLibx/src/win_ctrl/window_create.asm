;  window_create - create x window
;  Font and window size from window_pre can be used
;  to set window size and position.  From this the total
;  character rows and columns is calculated and the widow
;  is mapped (displayed).
;
; INPUTS
;  function window_pre must be called first.
;  ebp = window block created by window_pre
;
;  esi = ptr to window size request as follows:
;        resw 1 ;x pixel column location
;        resw 1 ;y pixel row location
;        resw 1 ;screen width in pixels
;        resw 1 ;screen height in pixels
; OUTPUT:
;    error = sign flag set
;
;     The window is maped (visable)
;     Keyboard, mouse, and expose events are enabled.
